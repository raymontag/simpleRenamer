This is a simple rename-tool with some nice options written in Python.

It's a spin-off of another project of mine called cuteRenamer.

In the directory where your tarball is extracted type "python setup.py install" with root-rights.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pre=PREFIX          set prefix that will be placed to the left of the
                        number
  --post=POSTFIX        set postfix that will be placed to the right of the
                        number

                        directory
